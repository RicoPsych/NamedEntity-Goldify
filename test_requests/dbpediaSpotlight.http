text=France has sent gas to Germany for the first time in "European solidarity" amid increasing energy pressures.\n\nThe gas, delivered via a pipeline, is part of a deal between the countries to ease energy shortfalls after Russian turned off the taps to Europe.\n\nThough the new flow is less than 2% of Germany's daily needs, it is welcome as Berlin battles to diversify its energy.\n\nRussia has been accused of using gas supplies as a weapon against the since the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFrench grid operator, GRTgaz, said it would initially deliver 31 gigawatt hours(GWh) per day, via a pipeline from the French border village of Obergailbach.\n\nThe maximum daily capacity of the new gas flow is 100 GWh, it added in a statement.\n\nLast month, in the energy solidarity deal, Germany pledged to provide additional electricity to France when needed, and in exchange France agreed to help Germany with gas supplies.\n\n"If we did not have European solidarity and an integrated, united market right now, we would have serious problems," said French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday.\n\nFrance is less affected by Russia turning off the gas taps because most of its energy needs are fulfilled by Norway and through liquified natural gas supplies.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine in February led to gas price hikes, and EU customers face record tariffs this winter.\n\nUntil then Germany relied on Russia for 55% of its gas. It has reduced this to 35% and wants eventually to reduce imports to zero.\n\nGermany is also increasing its use of coal and extending the life of power stations which were due to shut - despite the negative environmental impact.\n\nThe former German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she did not regret relying on Russia as a major gas supplier during her 16 years in government.\n\nThe German government hopes to reduce gas usage by 2% by limiting the use of lighting and heating in public buildings this winter.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday the gas taps could still be turned on to Europe and that "the ball, as they say, is now in European Union's court".\n&confidence=0.35
